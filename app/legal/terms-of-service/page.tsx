              These Terms are governed by the laws of England & Wales, excluding

              We may update these Terms to reflect changes in law or the
              Service. We will notify you at least 30 days in advance by e-mail
              or in-app alert. Continued use after the effective date
              constitutes acceptance. If you object, your sole remedy is to

              <strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign these Terms

              <br />
              <strong>No Waiver:</strong> Failure to enforce any provision is
              not a waiver of future enforcement.
